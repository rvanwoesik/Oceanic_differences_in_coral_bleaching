# Oceanic differences in coral-bleaching responses to marine heatwaves

---

### Description:
This study investigated the global spatio-temporal patterns of coral bleaching by employing the largest database of coral bleaching surveys compiled to date, which includes 23,288 surveys at 11,058 sites from 1980 to 2020. We examined coral bleaching responses worldwide using two modeling frameworks: (1) a spatially explicit Bayesian model, which allowed us to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data, and to generate predictive maps of the geographic variation in coral bleaching; (2) a deep-learning neural-network analysis that provided further insight into the relationship of coral bleaching with multiple environmental variables. 
Overall, our study demonstrates the extent of spatial and temporal variation in coral bleaching throughout the worldâ€™s oceans and shows several major differences among oceanic basins. We found that while the extent of coral bleaching varied between the oceans in different periods, bleaching has generally tended to occur at increasing temperatures in the last four decades. 
This study highlights that historical circumstances and geographical differences in oceanographic conditions play a significant role in contemporary coral-bleaching responses, leading to extensive geographical variability, for which we also provide relatively fine-scale maps.
